# On This Day

A simple rust binary for pulling the onthisday feed from wikipedia.

## Objectives

I would like to build this application to eventually serve as a welcome message for my terminal. I eventually would like it to be able to do the following:

* Display a random item from the onthisday feed.
* Be able to configure which categories to pull items from.
* Cache the items once a day, so that the entire feed is not having to be fetched each time the application is run.
* Make the output formatting somewhat configurable to allow for customization.
